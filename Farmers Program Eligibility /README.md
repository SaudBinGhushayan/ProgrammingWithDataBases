### Farmers Eligibility program 
This is a small project where I tested how effective `Jupyter Notebook` can be with data and how easy you can handle data with `Jupyter Notebook`

### In this Project I did the following :
1. Manually filled the `Eligibility.csv` __note__ I could filled it with a random generator but I wanted to know who's eligable and are not
2. Read the `Eligibility.csv` file using `pandas` python library 
3. I did a normal check up on the data like how many rows and columns ,checking for duplicates ,displaying the info of the dataset also displaying 
discriptive statistics  
4. After that I wrote the core code to test the Farmers who're eligable for the program and who are not
5. Some visualization after that
